. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTENT     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

COMPONENTS:

	- BEZIER SPLINE
		Defines a spline ("shape").
	
	- TERRAIN2D
		Applies Terrain2D Materials to splines.
		Controls local color Tint, material and toggles colliders creation (if defined in the material) for the current spline.
	
	- SPLINE DECORATOR
		Applies Decoration Materials to splines.
		Controls local color Tint and render materials for elements instantiated along the current spline.
	
	- QUICK DECORATOR
		Same behavior than Spline decorator, but does not require a Decorator material. 
		Intended for decorations that will not occur often, thus creating a material wouldn't be recommended 

	- SPLINE WATER
		Creates a mesh that reacts on contact with other physic objects.
		Creates necessary Colliders to detect physics.
		Simulates fluid surface and density, as well as adding forces during contact.
		Warning: Settings wrong values to Surface settings can create errors on runtime, 
		to avoid that, set a limit on your physics or visuals, and if happens, just Re-Build the mesh.
		
	- SPLINE TEXTURE
		optional: Creates a mesh around a spline with a lot of render options
		optional: instantiate any gameObject at the beggining of the Spline  
		optional: instantiate any gameObject at the end of the Spline
		Auto adjust scale, position and rotation of created objects to behave like a single smarter object

	- SPLINE MODIFIER WITH CALLBACKS
		Is an empty template for extending the code. Already setup for receiving callbacks when the spline is modified.
		Just implement the "ImmediateCallback" and/or "OnUpdateCallback" functions. More specific info at Official website.	
	

DATA:
	
	Every data is a ScriptableObject.

	- TERRAIN2D MATERIAL 
		Contains the references to sprites, materials, physics materials, physics settings and graphics settings.
		These settings can be applied to splines to create meshes and colliders.
		This style can be replicated on any Spline.
		By modifying the material automatically updates every spline that uses the material (if active/enabled).

	- TERRAIN2D ARCHITECTURE ANGLES
		Defines rules about which part of spline is considered Ground, or Wall, or Ceiling.
		It modifies the output of the Materials.
		
	- DECORATION MATERIAL
		A collection of Decoration Groups.
		By modifying the material automatically updates every spline that uses the material (if active/enabled).
		This style (or collection of styles) can be replicated on any Spline
		
	- DECORATION GROUP
		Contains references to assets and rules about how each element should be multiple times instantiated along a spline
		These settings can be applied to splines to instantiate thousands of Assets.
		Works with any asset (sprites, prefabs, lights, cameras, etc) 


SHADERS:

	Particles-Alpha Blended-Layers.shader:
		Is a copy from the standard "Particles/Alpha Blended" shader that allows Sorting Layers render. This shader is affected by Fog
	Sprite-Diffuse-Layers.shader
		Is a copy from the standard "Sprite/Diffuse" shader that allows Sorting Layerss render. This shader is affected by Lights

	
CREATING SPLINES:

	The next video explains this CREATING SPLINE section, perhaps you preffer to watch it instead of reading.
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP_GV7EiGsM	
	
	from Menu:            Tools / Kolibri2D / Spline (variants)
	You can add manually components or you can select the variant from the menu.
	
	* To add points in scene, your Scene View MUST BE IN 2D-VIEW and EDIT POINTS MODE enabled
	
	1- Click on EDIT to edit the spline points in the scene
	2- To create a point, click on scene when the guides are visible
	3- To delete a point select the point(s) and press [SUPR] or [DELETE]
		
	ADVANCED:
	
		SPLINE CONTROLS:
			- auto tangent - toggles between the traditional bezier control and the automatic control. You can notice that when a point moves...
							also its tangent changes direction and length with it, searching for the most natural curve.

			- Once you move manually the tangent points, it will remember your change, avoiding auto adjustments.
			- The color in the Inspector changes when a value a is not the default so you can spot the difference easily.
			- If you want to reset the values to default, you can drag values to 0 or use the mini button on the right side
	
		SMOOTHNESS:
			Smooth is a property I created to modify the shape in an easy way.
			This slider controls the length of every tangent point on the spline (except for those you specifically changed)
		
		SHAPE TAB:
			
			- When you select points, you can see its most basic properties in this tab.
			- EDIT POINTS mode also can be toggled by pressing [SPACE BAR] or [ENTER] or [INTRO]
			- auto Tangents on move auto-adjusts the  bezier control points (tangents) to create natural curves.
			- Smoothness controls the GENERAL length of each tangent point. 
				Moving the slider changes the appereance of the shape, making it totally squared or curved or anything between.
			- Multiple points can be selected or unselected by pressing [SHIFT] or [CONTROL]
				(works much nicer when auto-select-point is enabled)
			- Moving points is also possible in 3D-VIEW, and editing values can be done also from inspector 
			
		POINTS TAB:
		
			- Displays ALL the information for each point.
			- Allows you to set any value to every point in 1 click
				(align to any axis, tangent modes, subdivisions, smoothness)
			- When this tab is selected, all the tangents of the spline will be displayed on scene
			- You can customize the view to display only the information taht you need, avoiding large inspectors.
			- Also is another way to select points by index
				
		QUALITY TAB:
		
			Subidividing the spline is the easies way you can control the amount of meshes the terrain and textures will be subdivided.
			Also defines the physics collider's geometries. Allowing you to set the vertex & polygon count you want.
						
			CONSTANT MODE:
				
				- Every segment of the Spline will be subdivided in the amount of subidivisions you select.
			
			AUTO MODE:
				
				- This mode tries to find the best subdivsion value for each segment of the 
					spline, depending on the geometry of it.
				- 3 default levels: LOW, MID, HI
				
				USER DEFINED QUALITY:
				
					- There are several value multipliers that you can customize. This values controls directly
						the conditions to subdivide each segment based on its geometry.
						Example:  	"Straight Segment Multiplier" = 0
									This multiplier will take effect when a segment is a rect line from one segment to the other.
									In this case we can stablish to create a single segment to keep the vertex count low. 
					
					- Modifying the values of these multipliers will also affect the LOW, MID & HIGH quality.
				
		DEFINING SPLINE GLOBAL VALUES:

		SETTINGS
	
	In settings tab you can customize many things on the behavior and interface and also set the default values for new points or splines

	- Customize the size of handles	- You can 
	- Square or Linear Tangents 	- Changes the point handles in the scene view. Displaying a Square handle only for Linear tangents, making it easier to recognize.
	- Points always visible 		- select if you preffer the points to be always visible or only durin EDIT MODE
	- Auto select. 					- When AUTO SELECT it is enabled, the points are selected by positioning the mouse is on top of it, making the edition a bit faster
	
	
	Most of the time you want the same quality and characteristics for your scenario.
	
	So The Default Tangent Mode, Smoothness and Quality selected in this tab, allows you to set those default characteristics.
	The values you define this area, will be the default values for every new point or spline you create.
	This does not affect anything that is already created, its just the starting values for next terrains.
	These values are global and they can be changed by any spline.
	
CREATING MATERIALS:

	TERRAIN2D
	
		from menu:          Tools / Kolibri2D / Create Data / Terrain2D Material
		from Project Tab    Kolibri2D / Decoration Material
		
		Sprites used for terrain should set it's texture's WRAP MODE (on the texture inspector) to REPEAT  
	
		1- Drag your sprites into the correspondant slot (Ground, Wall, Ceiling of Fill)
		2- Under the Colliders Section, you can toggle physics settings for the terrain

		ADVANCED;
			- You can add rotation to the slot for avoiding duplicated sprites
			- Tile mode adaptative scales the mesh texture to always show complete sprites
			- Additional corner sprites can be added (and toggled)
			- By default corner sprites are shown as sprites, but can also be rendered as mesh using the selected shader
			- General settings :
			- width of the terrain sprites
			- offset from the spline towards or away from the spline
			- toggle Splith paths to join segments to each other by distorting the edges, or to keep independent edges 
			- Material to use on the created terrains
			- Set Layer and Order in Layer to avoid overlapping and Z-fighting glitches

			
	DECORATION MATERIAL
	
		from Menu:          Tools / Kolibri2D / Create Data / Decoration Material
		from Project Tab    Kolibri2D / Decoration Material
		
		1- Create new group
		2- Drag your assets in the corespondant slot ( Ground, Wall, Ceiling)

		ADVANCED:
			- select scale (or range of scales) that your instantiated assets will have
			- select offset from the spline towards or away from the spline (offset is a PERCENT of the size of each object)
			- select the positions settings ( Random or continuous ) 
			- Continuous defines how much space, margin, should be between each object. (as a PERCENT of the size of each object) 
			- Random positions defines a density.
			- Set Layer and Order in Layer to avoid overlapping and Z-fighting glitches
			- Set a maximum amount of allowed instantiated objects

		
MY SUGGESTIONS:

	- Most of the SLIDERS just move between sugested values, but THIS DOES NOT represent the actual limits of the values.
	- I recomend to keep Decoration group as independent as possible, only containing sprites or prefabs related to each other.
		Dont create several similar groups, you can reuse them in other materials.
		The more unique the content of each group is, the more you productivity you increase.
	- I strongly suggest you to explore the full potential of Architecture angles, since it can multiply drastically the usage of each material
